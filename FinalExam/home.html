	<p> Artist's curate a society of their own, in a black and bleek world they cause a sense of wonder, hope, and perceptiual understanding. From before language 
		and the cave men era, and ancient times, to the future. Artists from all around the world, give the world something to look forward to, 
		an understanding of other's current situations, and the ability of a personal and universal understanding all within a single 4x4 foot piece of once blank paper.

<p>The Mona Lisa is an Iconic, highly regarded, talked about master work of art, by the one and only Leonardo da Vinci - This portrait piece inhibits the epitomy of wonder, 
	being the most famous piece of art in the world. And simply of a woman, Lisa Gheradini, wife of a silk merchant- whom da Vinci was commisioned by. <br> 
	Can you imagine this original hanging on the mantle above your fireplace? The Mona Lisa painted against a distant landscape, with a stoic expression and life like features, 
	was at the center of the Renaissance period in art lives in Paris at the Louvre. <br> 
	This piece has caused wide conspiracy centered around the illuminati and thieft for an
	understanding of why and what makes this portrait, the most famous and highly regarded painting of all time.

	<h5> Art is Power,</h5> 
 <p>As noted with the Mona Lisa, the simplicity and as we will see, complexities of art awaken the humanity, simplicities, and understandings of us, humans</p>
