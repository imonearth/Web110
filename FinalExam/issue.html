<p> The Scream by Edvard Munch is an autobiographical work of the Symbolist Movement, 
    as the painting depicts, it is an abstraction of Munch himself, on a walk - experiencing 
    the chaos around him as internally he screams. This piece of art is classical, for the mere 
    imagination and creativity of Munch. The Scream is now on display at the National Museum in Oslo.
